# Passman: Password Management Tool

Passman is a simple yet secure password manager that allows you to store, retrieve, and manage your passwords. It supports features like encryption, password retrieval, and user verification. The app is designed with a clean interface and uses Angular for the frontend and a C# backend for secure password management.

2. Install the necessary dependencies for both the frontend and backend:
   - **Frontend (Angular)**:  
     Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run:

     ```
   - **Backend (C# .NET)**:  
     Navigate to the `backend` directory and run:
     ```bash
